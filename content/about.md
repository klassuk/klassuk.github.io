### QA Engineer

My name is Dmitry, and I am {{< age year=1984 month=4 >}}. I came into the testing profession full-time in 2018. I have a higher education degree in "Mathematical Software and Administration of Information Systems."

Since 2018, I have been working on commercial projects.

I am a cheerful, resourceful, and unique individual. I have my own perspective on assigned tasks (and often set them myself) and excel at finding optimal solutions. I am proactive and responsible, always bringing tasks to their logical conclusion.

I strive to continually develop and improve. I learn new things quickly and apply the acquired knowledge effectively.

I feel comfortable in a team and quickly find common ground with colleagues.

I am interested in automation and continually developing in this field. I am proficient in manual testing, enjoy classic ad-hoc testing (exploratory), and excel at complex E2E testing tasks.

I work across Linux, Windows, and macOS.

I prefer remote work, though it's not a strict requirement. I have basic knowledge of PHP, where I gained my initial experience in writing E2E tests. Currently, I am studying Python and the basics of Go.

In my free time, I enjoy practical shooting, table tennis, darts, and card games, especially poker. I also love motorsports.
