As a QA Engineer, my role was to ensure the high quality and functionality of the developed product, as well as to develop and implement effective testing approaches for various services, including APIs, web applications, mobile applications, and automated tests integrated into the continuous development process (CI/CD).

I specialized in using Selenium WebDriver and Laravel Dusk for web application test automation. During my time at the company, I also performed basic PHP development tasks, which allowed me to not only address minor issues but also actively participate in development.

My responsibilities included working on multiple projects simultaneously, effectively collaborating with developers, project managers, designers, SEO specialists, and other team members. I actively contributed to project development, from programming and organization to conducting motivational events, brainstorming sessions, lectures, and training. Additionally, I was involved in generating and managing tasks, coordinating approvals at various levels, and advocating for important business objectives.

My work also involved overseeing product rollout processes, making release and rollback decisions, conducting regression tests according to checklists and/or smoke testing, as well as stress testing in an environment with a large number of developers (more than 12 developers per tester). I also conducted interviews and managed the testing team.

Moreover, I actively maintained automated tests, ensuring their dependencies, code style, and architecture were up-to-date, and guaranteeing their effective operation.
