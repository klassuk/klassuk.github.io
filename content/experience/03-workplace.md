Information Technology, Communications, and Information Security Group
I was responsible for establishing and optimizing communication between departments, developing methods, and organizing the architecture. I ensured network security, including internet and departmental channels.
I tested web modules of the departmental network, wrote bug reports, and created checklists.

I provided setup and support for all infrastructure components based on Cisco and MikroTik equipment.

I also handled the commissioning and setup of workstations (ISOD), including remote workstations.
